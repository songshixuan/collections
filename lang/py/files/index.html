    The plot of Doctor Zhivago is long and intricate. It can be difficult to follow for two main reasons: first,
    Pasternak employs many characters, who interact with each other throughout the book in unpredictable ways, and
    second, he frequently introduces a character by one of his/her three names, then subsequently refers to that
    character by another of the three names or a nickname, without expressly stating that he is referring to the same
    character. To avoid this confusion, the summary below uses a character's full name when the character is first
    introduced.

<p class="novel02">
    mperial Russia, 1902.[4] The novel opens during a Russian Orthodox funeral liturgy, or panikhida, for Yuri's mother,
    Marya Nikolaevna Zhivago. Having long ago been abandoned by his father, Yuri is taken in by his maternal uncle,
    Nikolai Nikolaevich Vedenyapin, a philosopher and former Orthodox priest who now works for the publisher of a
    progressive newspaper in a provincial capital on the Volga River. Yuri's father, Andrei Zhivago, was once a wealthy
    member of Moscow's merchant gentry, but has squandered the family's fortune in Siberia through debauchery and
    carousing.
